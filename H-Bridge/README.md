Complete Eagle project along with the Bill Of Materials.

Zener diodes are not necessary.
Whether you include them or not depends on the Vcc you are using, while the exact diode's value solely depends on the transistor's Vgs.

As the IRF9540 was missing from the libraries i used IRF9530 which has the same pinout as IRF9540.
In the Bill Of Materials transistors A and C are listed correctly as IRF9540.
